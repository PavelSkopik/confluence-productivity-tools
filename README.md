# Confluence Productivity tools

Confluence Productivity Tools is an Atlassian Confluence plugin that aims
to implement productivity operations on content such as the following:

* Bulk operations on pages (deletion, splitting, joining)
* Reporting (reuse, attachments)

The focus is on bulk operations and operations that are not available
in the core Confluence but are often asked for by technical writing groups.

## Roadmap

* Page operations
    * Deletion
    * Splitting
    * Joining
* Content reporting
    * Content reuse in a space
    * Attachments use in a space
